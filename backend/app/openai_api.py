def get_string_response():
    ret = f"To generate a set of 7 random numbers based on the provided historical data, I would usually look at the frequency of each number to determine which numbers are drawn more often. \
        However, with the limited data you've provided, any patterns or trends may not be statistically significant, and using them to predict future numbers may not be any more effective \
            than generating completely random numbers. Nonetheless, I can provide you with a simple algorithmic approach to generate a pseudo-random set of numbers based on the provided history, \
                taking into account the frequency of each number: 1. Calculate the frequency of each number within the provided draws. 2. Normalize these frequencies to create weighted probabilities. \
                    3. Use these weighted probabilities to generate a random set of 7 unique numbers. For your specific request, \
                        you haven't specifically stated how you want the generated numbers to use the previous draws, \
                            so I'll provide you with a basic implementation without weighted probabilities since we don't have a programming environment here: \
                                - Randomly pick a number from each of the previous draws. - Ensure that you pick unique numbers until you have a set of 7. \
                                    Here is an 'emulated' set, with each number taken from different draws at random (keeping the uniqueness constraint in mind): \
                                        - From draw 951: 17 - From draw 952: 33 - From draw 953: 31 - From draw 954: 2 - From draw 955: 46 - From draw 956: \
                                            4 - From draw 957: 36 Resulting set: 17, 33, 31, 2, 46, 4, 36 Bear in mind, this is a quick emulation and does not \
                                                actually use a randomizing function due to the natural constraints of this environment. For a true random set based on frequency or any other criteria, \
                                                    you'd want to use statistical software or a programming language like Python or R, \
                                                        which can handle weighted probabilities and random number generation more effectively."
